# How to CSS

> I put this together as a crash course in CSS for our summer interns. It's bits and pieces of a class I taught at Parsons. Probably not very useful out in the wild.

## To install

You will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) globally installed. Then,

    > git clone git@github.com:nathanstilwell/how-to-css.git
    > npm install -d


## To run

    > gulp

Then cross your fingers and follow along.
